' the .frm designed are re-quantized the same way. A corpus scan over 105 design
' files measured 238 geometry values that are NOT a multiple of 15 (NewTab-test 86,
' ctrlslider 22, btnfocus 15, ... -- positions authored on a 120-DPI machine), so
' every one of those read back wrong before this fixture existed.
'   GC01/GC02   design numbers read back exactly (form route + container-child route)

'               number implies, so the stored value did NOT move anything
'   GC04/GC05   runtime write and Move read back exactly (write side is the same
'               cache -- Move was the unverified half of ledger 193)
'   GC06        a pixel-mode container still reads pixels (the stored-twips cache
'               fails the unit gate there -- measured identical before/after)
'   GC07        switching the container's ScaleMode re-projects, switching back
'               returns the VB-side number again
'   GC08        self-heal: ComboBox is resized by the RTL at creation (dropdown
'               area), so its cached design height is stale and the read follows
'               the window instead -- the pixel gate is what makes that safe
'   GC09..GC12  the late-bound route (the RTL host model behind IDispatch) answers
'               the same numbers as the emitted one -- it used to carry a second
'               geometry implementation that never stored the VB-side value
'   GC17..GC19  a member enumerated out of Controls is that control and nobody else's,
'               and a With block over a Collection member writes that control
'   GC20..GC23  an enumerated member can say who it is (.Name / TypeName / .Index)
