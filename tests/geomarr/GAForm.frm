' Ledger 230 (the VB-side geometry cache) verified three write roads -- the four
' property setters, vb6_ControlMove and vb6_CreateControl -- but every judge it
' added reads a SINGLELY-NAMED control. Nothing ever asked an ARRAY ELEMENT, and
' the element road is a different host expression in the emitted code
' (vb6_CtrlArr_GetAt(&vb6_arr_<name>, i)), while the storage itself is keyed by
' (window, property). The corpus writes geometry into array elements whose design
' numbers are not a multiple of 15, so a route that quietly fell back to
' projecting the window would answer one grid-step off on every read -- and before
' this fixture the whole suite would still have been green.
'   GA01/GA02   both design-time elements read back their own .frm numbers, each
'               with a pixel witness (user32 rect + kernel32 MulDiv, never the
'               product's own conversion) so "stored" cannot mean "did not place"
'   GA03        a runtime write to an element reads back the requested number
'   GA04        Move on an element reads back all four and lands the window
'   GA05        the two elements are two windows: moving one leaves the other
'   GA05c       the two handles compared straight (no CLng round-trip) answer like
'               numbers -- a handle is a pointer value, and VB6 hands hWnd out as Long
'   GA05d       the same type answer on the two stringify roads: a handle prints its
'               digits, and CStr of a DC-shaped read stays on the Variant road
'   GA06        the array never swallows its single-named sibling's write
