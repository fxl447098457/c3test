REM ============================================================
REM build.bat - portable build for C3
REM
REM Locates the Visual Studio C++ toolset via vswhere (no hardcoded
REM install path), sets up the x64 environment, then runs the existing
REM build. Usage:
REM     build.bat                (builds .build, the default)
REM     build.bat --clean        (reconfigure + build .build)
REM     build.bat --dir some\dir (build a different build dir)
REM
REM Ninja is always taken from the Visual Studio installation - never from
REM PATH, so no third-party ninja can be picked up. The VS instance is
REM therefore resolved with the optional "CMake tools for Visual Studio"
REM component required as well: if the newest VS with the C++ toolset does
REM not ship Ninja, the newest VS that does is used instead and a NOTICE is
REM printed, so the toolchain choice is never silent. If no VS installation
REM ships Ninja at all, this fails loudly instead of letting CMake report a
REM bare "ninja not found".

REM shift happens outside a block on purpose: %~1 inside a parenthesized block
REM is expanded once before the block runs, so a shift in there left BDIR set
REM to the literal string --dir. The error check must not use "& exit" either -
REM outside a block that exit would run unconditionally.
